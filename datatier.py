# When calling servers on a network, calls can randomly fail. 
# The better approach is to repeat at least N times (typically 
# N=3), and then give up after N tries.

def web_service_get(url):
    """
    Submits a GET request to a web service at most 3 times, since
    web services can fail to respond e.g. to heavy user or internet
    traffic. If the web service responds with status code 200, 400
    or 500, we consider this a valid response and return the response.
    Otherwise we try again, at most 3 times. After 3 attempts the
    function returns with the last response.

    Parameters
    ----------
    url: url for calling the web service

    Returns
    -------
    response received from web service
